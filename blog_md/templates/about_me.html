    Hi, my name is Andrew.
    I grew up in Wisconsin and received my Bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2007, studying epithelial wound repair and cytokinesis in the lab of Bill Bement.
    Following my undergraduate work, I moved to Dresden, Germany to the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, where I did his PhD studying the organization and mechanics of the cellular actin cortex in the lab of Ewa Paluch.

    Following a short follow-up postdoc at University College London, I moved to Paris, France to do a postdoc at the Institut Curie in the lab of Danijela Vignjevic.
    During my postdoc, I studied collective cell migration in a number of contexts, including using microfluidic devices to study collective chemotaxis, mechanical interactions between cells and ECM networks during migration and collective migration in the intestinal epithelium.

<p class="space-below-small">
    I started my own lab in May 2021 as a joint position between the University of Stuttgart Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology and the University of TuÌˆbingen Center for Personalized Medicine, where my lab studies intestinal epithelial dynamics in physiology and disease.
